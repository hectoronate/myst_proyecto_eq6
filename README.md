## Description
This is the final project for the course of Microstructures and trading systems, where we are going
to setup a trading strategy built by 3 main metrics and we are going to backtest it in a train dataset,
optimize it and backtest it again in a test dataset in order to try to achieve a profitable strategy and 
apply the knowleadge that we have been acquiring.

## Install dependencies

Install all the dependencies stated in the requirements.txt file, just run the following command in terminal:

        pip install -r requirements.txt
        
Or you can manually install one by one using the name and version in the file.

## Funcionalities:

The main functionality for the project is to register and backtest a trading 15 min timeframe strategy,
using the Stochastic Relative Strength Index,3 Exponential Moving Average and the Average True Range
in order to calculate the price targets.
